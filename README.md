How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation is an app's ability to continue to function despite not being supported by the local device. Service workers help with this by allowing access to the site when such requirements are not met, such as when there is no internet. Through service workers, users can get all or parts of the app functional to use despite minor shortcomings, supporting the idea of graceful degredation.
